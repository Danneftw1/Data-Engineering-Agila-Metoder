# Exercise 1 - Docker

Use bash a lot for exercise but you can use GUI tools such as a code editor to edit your code files.

---

## 0. warmup (\*)

a) Create this file structure

```bash
Exercise1
├── Dockerfile
└── src
    └── ex1_0_setup.py
    └── ex1_1_setup.py
```
- Answer:
```bash
$ mkdir Exercise1
$ cd    Exercise1
$ touch Dockerfile
$ mkdir src
$ cd    src
$ touch ex1_{0..1}_setup.py
```

b) Create a Dockerfile with base image Python 3.9 and with the following packages.

- matplotlib
- plotly_express
- pandas
- numpy
- dash
- sklearn

Make sure ex1_0.py runs when the container starts. Also specify the working directory to /Exercise1 inside of the container.

- Answer:
```docker
FROM python:3.9

# Add the entire src directory to the container at /Exercise1/src
ADD src /Exercise1/src

# Installing required packages with pip
RUN pip install plotly_express dash sklearn

# Specify the working directory as /Exercise1 inside the container
WORKDIR /Exercise1

# Run ex1_0_setup.py when the container starts
CMD ["python", "src/ex1_0_setup.py"]
```
In my case this might not work, when creating the image you have to remove packages one at a time to figure out which doesn't work and what does work (only need to do this if you're getting package errors when trying to create image).

c) Create a docker image with name ex1-image

- Answer

```bash
$ docker build -t ex1-image .
```

d) Spin up your docker container and name it ex1-container.
- Answer
```bash
$ docker run -it --name ex1-container ex1-image
```
If you're having issues with creating a container that stays active and doesn't exit immidietly, follow this instead:

```bash
$ docker run -dit ubuntu
```
Then rename the container to desired name: Stop container, rename, start again

```bash
$ docker stop <old-container-name>
$ docker rename <old-container-name> <new-container-name>
$ docker start <new-container-name>
```

e) Go into your container and make sure that these packages are installed.
- Answer
```bash
$ docker exec -it ex1-container pip list
```
f) Create a bash script that lists the installed packages.
- Answer
```bash
$ nano installed_packages.sh
```
```sh
#!/bin/bash

cd src
pip list
```
```bash
CTRL + X > Y > ENTER
```
```bash
$ chmod +x installed_packages.sh
```
```bash
$ ./installed_packages.sh
```

g) Now create a Python script that prints out the installed packages and the version of Python.
- Answer
```bash
$ cd    src
$ touch script.py
```
```py
import subprocess
import sys

print("Running sript.py Python script")

# running the installed_packages.sh script in the Exercise1 folder
subprocess.call(['sh', '../installed_packages.sh'])

# Printing python version
print("Python version")
print(sys.version)
```

h1) Spin up the container in interactive mode. Here are some stuffs you can explore

- Answer pt.1
- First open Ubuntu and:
```bash
cd /YOURPATH/Exercise1
#run commands like:
docker ps
#To check that you still see active docker image and container
```
- Then run the following in Ubuntu:
```bash
$ docker exec -it ex1-container /bin/bash
```
- Now you are in interactive mode.


h2)
- check your current directory
- Answer
```bash
pwd
```
- list all files
- Answer
```bash
ls -al
```
- navigate to parents and list files
- Answer
```bash
cd .. && ls -al
```
- list all files inside Exercise1
- Answer
```bash
ls -al /Exercise1
```
- count all files and folders inside Exercise1
- Answer
```bash
ls -al /Exercise1 | wc -l
```
- check your OS
- Answer
```bash
uname -a
```

- check the current date
- Answer
```bash
date
```
- take a snapshot of the current python packages with corresponding versions and pipe them into requirements2.txt
- Answer
```bash
pip freeze > requirements2.txt
```
- check the differences in requirements2.txt and requirements.txt
- Answer
```bash
diff /Exercise1/requirements.txt /Exercise1/requirements2.txt
```

## 1. It's the final countdown (*)

Now you will create a Python script to keep track of time to different events. This is the list of events we would like to have a countdown to

| Event            | Date             |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| summer_break     | 2023-06-9 15:00  |
| lia_start        | 2023-09-25 8:00  |
| christmas        | 2023-12-24       |
| bellas_birthday  | 2023-12-07       |
| new_year         | 2024-01-01       |
| graduation_party | 2024-06-09 16:30 |

a) Make a script to get the following output to a file called countdown.log inside the folder logs. The logs directory is a sibling to the src directory.

- Answer
```bash 
$ touch f_c_script.py
$ code f_c_script.py
```
- Python script:
```py
import os
from datetime import datetime

# get the current directory of the current script:
script_dir = os.path.dirname(__file__)

# Event dates:
events = {
    "summer_break": datetime(2023, 6, 9, 15, 0),
    "lia_start": datetime(2023, 9, 25, 8, 0),
    "christmas": datetime(2023, 12, 24),
    "new_year": datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    "graduation_party": datetime(2024, 6, 9, 16, 30)
}

# Define logs directory path:
logs_dir = os.path.join(script_dir, "..", "logs")

# Create logs directory if it does not exist:
if not os.path.exists(logs_dir):
    os.makedirs(logs_dir)

# Define path of the log file:
log_file = os.path.join(logs_dir, "countdown.log")


# create or open file inside logs directory:
with open(log_file, "w") as f:

    #Write current date and time:
    f.write(f"-------------------------------------------------\nCountdown from {datetime.now()}\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n")
    # Write each event and the remaining time until it:
    for event, event_date in events.items():
        time_left = event_date - datetime.now()
        f.write(f"Countdown to {event}: {time_left.days} days, {time_left.seconds // 3600} hours, {(time_left.seconds // 60) % 60} minutes\n")
        #print(f"Countdown to {event}: {time_left.days} days, {time_left.seconds // 3600} hours, {(time_left.seconds // 60) % 60} minutes\n")
```


b) Make a cron schedule inside of your docker container in interactive mode to run your script

Note that you might need to install

- crontab
- nano  
  

### Answer:   
  
First open Ubuntu and:
```bash
cd /YOURPATH/Exercise1
#run commands like:
docker ps
#To check that you still see active docker image and container
```
- Then run the following in Ubuntu: (dont forget to update your image / container)
```bash
$ docker exec -it ex1-container /bin/bash
```
- Now you are in interactive mode.
### Install Cron and Nano
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y cron nano
# -y option automatically answers 'yes' to the prompts.
```
- run the nano editor:
```bash
crontab -e
```
- It looks like this:
<img src="../assets/crontab-e.jpg" width = 400>

```bash
0 * * * * /Exercise1/src/f_c_script.py
Press CTRL X.
Press Y to Save
Press ENTER at:
File Name to Write: /tmp/crontab.XXXXaBcDeF
```

Let it run for couple of minutes, the output should look something like this 

<details>

<summary>check the output</summary>

<img src="../assets/countdown_b.png" width = 400>

</details>

c) Stop your cron schedule and create another script that will output the events table to the beginning of countdown.log. Now schedule so that the script outputting to countdown.log happens once and then afterwards the countdown table should log every two minutes. (**)

## 2. Pokeiness (\*)-(\***)

Professor Oak is an expert in pokemons, and have developed a device for measuring a pokemons happiness level. He needs your help in performing a pokexperiment collecting data and visualizing them in a dashboard. As a poke professor he loves structure in his files, use this structure. Note that the pokemons in the pokebelt are example gotten from one run and observations are from transform_load after two runs. 

```bash
Exercise2
├── pokedata
│   ├── observations
│   │   ├── observation_23-05-18_17_34.csv
│   │   ├── observation_23-05-18_18_34.csv
│   ├── pokebelt
│   │   ├── fearow.json
│   │   ├── kabutops.json
│   │   ├── magneton.json
│   │   ├── poliwag.json
│   │   ├── vulpix.json
│   │   └── zapdos.json
│   └── pokelist.json
└── scripts
    ├── extract_data.py
    ├── poke_dashboard.py
    ├── release_pokemons.sh
    └── transform_load.py
```

Tasks a) and b) should be made in extract_data.py

a) Start by collecting a list of all pokemons from first generation (151 pokemons). Scrape this list from [wikipedia "Lista över Pokémon"](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_%C3%B6ver_Pok%C3%A9mon) and save it as a json file in pokedata/pokelist.json. This json file should contain the poke index and the corresponding pokemon. Save this python script in 

```json
{"1":"Bulbasaur","2":"Ivysaur","3":"Venusaur","4":"Charmander","5":"Charmeleon","6":"Charizard","7":"Squirtle","8":"Wartortle","9":"Blastoise","10":"Caterpie", ...}
```

b) With the pokelist we can now randomly pick six numbers from 1-151 to catch and put in our pokebelt. Use this api to get the data [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/pikachu]("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/pikachu"), where you change pikachu to another pokemon name. Remember to add a pause for at least 2 seconds before each get request, you can use requests library to make a request. 

c) Now transform (clean) your data from the pokebelt and load (save) the observations in a csv file with timestamp in the name.  There should be a transform and a load function in your script. Example content of csv file.

```csv
pokemon,happiness
fearow,70
kabutops,50
magneton,50
poliwag,50
vulpix,50
zapdos,35
```

d) Create a bash script that cleans the pokebelt. 

e) Make a cron schedule inside of your container to clean the pokebelt, extracting new pokemons and load observations. 

f) Now make a dashboard showing the different pokemons and their happiness level. Choose a proper graph to show this.

g) As a non technical person professor Oak don't want to manage installations of softwares. Write clear detailed instructions for professor Oak how to use Docker to see the dashboard. This dashboard don't need to handle scheduling and updates. (**)

h) Make the dashboard have a dropdown to choose observations. Assume we catch new set of six pokemons every five minutes. We want it scheduled such that the dashboard is updated. (***)

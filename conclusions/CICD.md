## Formatting

- Black - Same formatting that we've used before
- Import organizer - sorts all your imports (built in, third party & your own files)

## Tests

Find and fix errors before everything goes live. Obviously very important to save time and money in the future.

It's important to do tests when you're working, however, You don't need to do tests as often as it might seem. In other words; do tests, just not for every single row of code.

# Exercises

Exercises are not compulsory but very much essential to be able to understand how to implement the different concepts yourself. If you master the exercises, the project will be much easier to handle and in the longer perspective also your job as a data engineer, data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer, ... 

Use whatever tool available to solve the exercises, for example ChatGPT, but remember to learn the concepts and not just copy and paste code as this will slow down your learning. Also it is good to discuss with friends on how to solve the exercises. Note that there is no answer sheets for the exercises, which is the fact in industry as well. Figure out how you can validate and convince others that you solved the tasks.

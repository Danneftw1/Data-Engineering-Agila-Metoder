# Lecture 3 - First ETL pipeline

This lecture is special, here we won't go through the code together, instead you should do Exercise3-ETL. The purpose is for you to connect theory to actual code and to read and understand other peoples code. Then you will have to use other peoples code and build upon it to satisfy stakeholders requirements. It is not uncommon that you will meet this scenario in industry and you are expected to build upon others work, and sometimes the code is not well documented and you don't get a proper handover.

Also you will have to read more theory and be able to present to stakeholders when asked. In data engineering it is very important to be able to communicate theory and practical implications in a clear way as data engineering can have huge economical impact. It is thus not enough to have LLMs to comment your code, you need to understand how systems work in larger setting and sometimes in detail. LLMs can though be very helpful for you to learn the concepts.

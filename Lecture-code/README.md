# Lecture code 

In this directory, all prepared lecture codes will be stored here. Note that this could be py scripts, dockerfiles, markdown files etc depending on what the topic is. Also it's important to distinguish this folder from the code-alongs folder where code is produced live during class and can differ somewhat to the prepared materials. 

It is recommended that you read these code or lecture notes before thet class.

# Lecture theory

In this directory the theory, primarily in the form of slides will be uploaded. The slides contain theory that is important to understand different concepts and the bigger picture, while the lecture codes are more hands on how to perform various tasks. Note that it's important to understand both concepts and practical implementations. 

You need the concepts to both understand what you are doing and to be able to explain to others in your team and other stakeholders. A recommendation is therefore to read the theory and concepts before diving in to the code.

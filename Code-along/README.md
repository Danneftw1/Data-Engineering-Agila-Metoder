# Code alongs

The code that is produced live during lectures will be added to this directory. Note that much of the codes are simplified versions from Lecture-code directory which are fully annotated. 

Also during the code alongs, git branches will be used to mark different milestones of the lecture codes and file structures so if you want to go back to a particular time of the coding you can use 

```bash
git log --oneline
git checkout <branch hashcode>
```
